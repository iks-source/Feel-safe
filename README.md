# feel_safe

We want to develop a system that can contribute towards a better society for women. Our system is intended to reduce violence against women and girls. Act of violence against women is not new and has been in our society for a long time. But recent technologies and labor of thousands social workers have helped reduce this by a huge margin. Even though its 2021 now, and most people has access to internet and other media platforms, act of violence still exists. According to SDG website, lockdowns are increasing the risk of violence and women and girls. In some countries cases of domestic violence have increased by 30% [4]. These acts are often overlooked. It is very possible that such things have happened in our family but due to normalization of male dominancy, we did not simply think twice about it. Ignorance of these small acts most of the time contributes to major violent acts. In this scenario, many women are still afraid to come out or simply are unaware of their rights and people that are fighting to ensure that right is preserved. Our system is intended to be used by them and give them an easier way to express their concerns and raise voice against violence.

The project requirements of “Feel safe” is to develop a system that can contribute towards a better society for women. The system has two different users such as admin and user. Each of them has access to a handful of features which developers determined in chapter 3. All the initial requirements mentioned in chapter 3 have been achieved except the priority list which requires a whole new model to implement and makes the system sluggish. Furthermore, feedback from user testing, Supervisor consultation, and FYP 1 showcase, developers have taken note of a few more additional features that developers have added to the system successfully. The completed features are mentioned below:
The initial features provided for the users:
    • Post their story or content.
    • View other people’s content.
    • Interact with each other.
    • Connect with the admins.
    • Ask for help and advice from the admin.
    • View job opportunities.
    
The initial features provided for the admins:
    • Monitor overall activity of the platform.
    • Delete unrelated content.
    • Add or remove users.
    • Post content and success stories
    • Response to users via chat and comment
    • Post job opportunism for the users.
    
The additional features that were added for users:
    • Apply for a job and upload their CV
    • Request and send money for donation
    • View FAQ to quickly resolve issues
    
The additional features that were added for admins:
    • Create FAQ
    • Request and send money for donation
    • View applicants for a job, review their CV
    • Update job status such as Pending, Accepted, and rejected.
    
One important notice that needs to be mentioned is the security concern. As developers are yet to get involved with payment gateways, they have decided to make the donation feature as a dummy, so it does not raise any security concerns. And as for our database, its build off google so data leak chances are very low and lastly, developers are really grateful to be able to develop every feature that they proposed.
